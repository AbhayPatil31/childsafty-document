- Contain, distribute, or link to **child sexual abuse material (CSAM)**
- Involve **grooming**, solicitation, or any form of endangerment of minors
- Encourage or depict harmful behavior toward children

### Our Enforcement Actions
- All user-generated content (polls, surveys, comments, uploads) is monitored.
- Any suspected CSAE/CSAM will be **removed immediately**.
- Confirmed violations are reported to relevant authorities, including the **National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC)** and/or local law enforcement (e.g., in India).

### User Reporting
